**Securing Chatbots Against Prompt Injection (Demo Scenario):**
- Protect AI-powered chatbots on ecommerce or enterprise websites from prompt injection attacks that attempt to access unauthorized or sensitive customer data.
- As shown in the demo video, the AI Firewall can distinguish between secure and non-secure chat interfaces: only the secure chat window blocks malicious requests, preventing data leaks even when the underlying LLM has access to private databases.
- Enables safe integration of LLMs with business-critical systems by enforcing strict access controls at the prompt level.


## Business Use Cases


The AI Firewall is designed to address real-world business challenges related to AI safety, compliance, and responsible deployment. Here are some more business use cases:

- **Content Moderation for User-Generated Platforms:**
	- Automatically detect and block harmful, toxic, or policy-violating prompts in chatbots, forums, and social media platforms.
	- Protect brand reputation and ensure community guidelines are enforced at scale.

- **Enterprise Data Protection:**
	- Prevent sensitive or confidential information from being leaked through AI-powered assistants or customer support bots.
	- Enforce compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) by filtering prompts and responses.

- **AI Safety for Regulated Industries:**
	- Deploy in healthcare, finance, or legal sectors to ensure AI systems do not generate or act on unsafe, biased, or non-compliant content.
	- Provide audit trails and explainability for moderation decisions.

- **Responsible AI Deployment:**
	- Integrate with LLM APIs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.) to add a safety layer before user input reaches the model.
	- Reduce risk of AI misuse and support responsible innovation.

- **Customizable Moderation for SaaS Providers:**
	- Offer moderation-as-a-service for SaaS platforms, enabling clients to tailor safety rules to their business needs.
	- Support multi-tenant deployments and role-based access control.

These use cases demonstrate the AI Firewall's value in protecting users, businesses, and society from the risks associated with generative AI, while enabling safe and scalable adoption of AI technologies.
